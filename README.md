<h3>A FARM stack based application project</h3>

Welcome to ToDo Notes FARM Project! 
This project serves as an entry-level exploration of the FARM stack (FastAPI - React - MongoDB). 
<br>Its primary objective is to gain knowledge about the technologies involved. All you can find here follows what shown in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8MsHbCzyZ4&t=6188s&ab_channel=ABDLogs) and serves as a comprehensive guide for beginners who wish to gain familiarity with these tools. 
<br>You can find a lot of material in GitHub as well if you are interested in more FARM-based projects.

<h4>FARM Stack Overview</h4>
The FARM stack is a powerful combination of FastAPI, React, and 
MongoDB, designed to facilitate the development of modern web 
applications. <br>
Each component plays a crucial role in the overall architecture:<br>
